Artefact is a web interface which can be used to search and display images of artefacts from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Queries may be filtered by medium and/or keywords before pressing 'SEARCH' to return a collection of matching objects. Click images to display more information, or navigate through the search collection using the section at the bottom of page. 
    
 Artefact was built in React and communicates with the MET museum API. The application is still in beta, but was built as a means to access and display the museums collection remotely using a minimalistic interface.
    
 The font used is 'Sporting Grotesque' by Lucas Le Bihan, George Triantafyllakos & Maciej Połczyński.
